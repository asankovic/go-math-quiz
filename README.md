# Golang Math Quiz
Simple Math Quiz CLI app written in Go, in purpose of learning basic Go concepts. Based on [GopherExercise #1](https://github.com/gophercises/quiz), but slightly modified with some custom additions.
# Description
Basic idea of this app is to give user math tasks, and validate their input. App has a few flags which present options for customization:

| Flag | Type | Description | Default value |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| file | string | CSV file containing tasks for quiz. Format must be 'task,answer'. If not passed, random tasks will be generated by the program. <br/> Your file can contain any type of tasks, it is only required for them to be in the format `<number\> (+ \| - \| * \| %) <number> =` (see example in questions.csv). <br/> Generated questions will, for the sake of simplicity of working with integers, have the following operations: **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and modulo**. | "" (empty string) |
| level | int | Level is considered only when generating tasks. Number of level basically corresponds to number of digits in numbers used for tasks. Max level is 4, if passed higher number, it will be defaulted to 1. <br/> **Example**: choosing level 2 may generate numbers between 10 and 100 (not including 100) for your tasks.|1|
| quantity | int | Number of tasks per questioning session. <br/> **Note:** this may use a subset of your questions, if a provided file contains more of them. | 10 |
| shuffle | bool | Wether tasks should be shuffled before each questioning session. | false |
| timeLimit | int | Time, in seconds, you will have to solve the tasks. 0 means there is no time limit. <br/> With time running out, the quiz will stop on the question you were at, at that time| 0 |

For more info, run the app with the flag **-h**.

App will take provided flags, and form a math quiz. Quiz is replayable by interacting with the app, but the questions will repeat (may be reshuffled if shuffle is enabled). Generated tasks are saved in new CSV file for user to take a look at, or reuse later on.
